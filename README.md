- 👋 Hi, I’m @Oxzus
- 👀 I’m interested in ... reality
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... every day
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything interesting
- 📫 How to reach me ... idk
- 😄 Pronouns: ... are words we use to categorize
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm thinking ...

- I don't really know why I'm here; my latest attempt screaming into the void to see if I get a reply.  I am working on a spacecraft to take me far, far away, if only in my dreams.

- I have an array of parts, and a bit of know-how, and some vague idea of trade-offs.

- I am flexing muscles never exceptional, and long unused.

- If you are a kind soul willing to join my crew, I'd be glad to have you, and I'll do my best to never steer us wrong.

- If you're a waste of space, slacker, cheat, liar or other sort of scumbag, well met; let's move on, instead of gitn ugly.

- I don't know folks; I'm an eccentric one.  Building my home office/mood room/man cave/gaming rig/simpit.  Needs to handle pretty much anything.  I'm calling this revision Covimoniuisola posotus fatanastic.

- There's a mechanical keyboard here; a couple Arduino megas; I see some leds.  There's numbers on everything around here ... HC595, RP2040, ... symbols and what appear to be acronyms everywhere.
